After your presentation, three panelists will ask you questions from the list of oral defense questions found in pages 52-53 of the [AP Research Course and Exam Description](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-research-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-research). The panel will ask you three questions: one question from each of the three sections. Around mid-March, you should choose one of the document links above to fill in responses to the questions in preparation for your oral defense in April.

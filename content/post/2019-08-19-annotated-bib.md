In preparation for the literature review section of your paper, you will develop an annotated bibliography of your sources. For each your annotated bibliography entries, you can use the following guiding questions:
    
  1\. **Summarize:** What are the main ideas of your source? (2--4 sentences)
        
  2\. **Evaluate:** How does your source relate to other sources in establishing the current understanding of your research topic? (1--2 sentences)
  
  * As long as your sources are relevant scholarly works (e.g., peer-reviewed journal articles in your field of inquiry), you do not need to focus on author credibility, which is more of an AP Seminar topic.
    
  * In AP Research, you want to focus on establishing your own credibility by demonstrating that you can select relevant sources and synthesize connections between sources.
            
  3\. **Reflect:** How will you use this source in your paper? (1--2 sentences)
  
  * How will this source help you develop methods to extend the current understanding of your research topic?

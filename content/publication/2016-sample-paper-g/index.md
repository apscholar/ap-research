abstract: The potential special impacts of genetic testing on minorities are considered using a qualitative research approach. Using a review of studies on genetic testing and studies on health care issues for minorities, areas of concern were established as possible sources of a discrepancy in the impact of genetic testing between minority and majority populations. The most important areas of concern were identified to be access and cost of health care, public education about genetic testing, and security of databases with genetic information. Policies centered on specific populations, access to health care facilities and professionals, flow of information to the consumer, and security of databases are recommended to abate this troubling discrepancy.

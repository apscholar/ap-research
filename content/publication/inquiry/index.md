You can find the original version of the Inquiry Proposal Form on page 55 of the [AP Research Course Description](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-research-course-and-exam-description.pdf). You may use the Word or LaTeX versions (accessed via the buttons above) as templates.

Fill out this form and e-mail it to your teacher for approval. You cannot proceed with your research until your teacher approves your form.

You should also look over the [Research Proposal Guidelines](/publication/proposal), which will be a more developed version of your inquiry proposal. The research proposal will document your initial stages of research following the approval of your research topic and inquiry form.

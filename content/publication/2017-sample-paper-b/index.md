abstract: South Korean pop music, or K-Pop, is a rapidly growing sector of the music industry, and has experienced increased economic success and international exposure over the last few years. Although a variety of possible causes have been postulated for this heightened popularity, this study aims to quantitatively analyze one aspect of K-Pop in particular - the music itself. Utilizing a novel method involving musical correlational analytics, this research will anatomize successful K-Pop songs released between 2014 and 2016 and parse existing databases for records of those songs. These two sets of information will then be compared with each other and evaluated for meaningful correspondence. The results of this evaluation potentially hold revelations of how a K-Pop songâ€™s content and commercial success are linked, leading to large-scale implications in terms of how K-Pop music producers choose to develop their songs. Beyond these in dustry-sp  ecific ramifications, however, this study also adopts a methodology that can be applied to analyze other styles of music.

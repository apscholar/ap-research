To my students: Instead of e-mailing me to schedule a time to meet, please use the link above to sign up for a time slot. While walks-in are always welcome during my regular office hours, you may have to wait if another student has scheduled for a time slot.

Time slots are by default 30 minutes long, but you may schedule for multiple time slots if your requested meeting requires more time.

If you cannot make it to my regular office hours, please check with me before or after class to arrange for a time to meet. For all other non-scheduling issues and matters that cannot be addressed during office hours, please use the e-mail form below to contact me. Thank you for following these procedures.
